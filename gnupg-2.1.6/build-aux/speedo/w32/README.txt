1. Important Notes
==================

This is the core part of the GnuPG system as used by several other
frontend programs.  This installer does not provide any graphical
frontend and thus almost everything needs to be done on the command
line.  However, a small native Windows GUI tool is included which is
used by GnuPG to ask for passphrases.  It provides only the basic
functionality and is installed under the name "pinentry-basic.exe".
Other software using this core component may install a different
version of such a tool under the name "pinentry.exe" or configure the
gpg-agent to use that version.

See https://gnupg.org for latest news.  HowTo documents and manuals
can be found there but some have also been installed on your machine.

Development and maintenance of GnuPG is mostly financed by donations;
please see https://gnupg.org/donate/ for details.
