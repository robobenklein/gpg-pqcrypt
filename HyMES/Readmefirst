This is the first version of our implementation. We call it HyMES-Beta-0 version.

This is rather a tool than a software. The results we produced are created by it.


This programme has been tested in Pentium-III, Pentium-IV and core 2-duo machines all running in 32 bit linux operating system architectures. 


The authors are Bhaskar Biswas and Nicolas Sendrier (bhaskar.biswas@inria.fr; nicolas.sendrier@inria.fr).
